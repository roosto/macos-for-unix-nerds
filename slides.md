# macOS & Unix: Two Great Tastes that Taste Great Together! #

---

## Why? ##

* Mid-90s Apple is circling the drain, their OS is a shared memory disaster
* In order to save its bacon, and have a shot at a modern OS, Apple buys NeXT in 1996 (guess who the founder & CEO of NeXT is ü§î)
* macOS n√© Mac OS X is adapted from NeXTSTEP, which is based off of BSD Unix (BSD is different from linux, b/c GNU)

Now the Mac has a lovely unix underpinning üéâüòéü•≥üéä

---

## GUI ‚Üí CLI Tips ##

* Drag a file onto the terminal to get its path put on the command line
* In the Finder `‚áß‚åòG` gives a dialogue box to open a location, that can use tab completion.
* Pressing `/` or `‚áß‚åòG` in any file picker dialogue will give you the same file location dialogue box.
* Show/hides hidden files in a save dialogue box, or in the Finder: `‚áß‚åò.` (more on this later)

---

## Text Editing ##

System-wide support for many [GNU readline shortcuts][Readline shortcuts]

Most text editing areas in macOS, from file save to web forms will support Readline shortcuts. Many interactive unix programs also support/use readline, so learning these shortcuts is quite useful.

---

## Homebrew ##

The only sane way to install 3rd party unix software on your mac

* Homebrew installs unix utilities properly, inside `/usr/local`
* You should _always_ be wary of an installer that wants your administrator password
* You should almost w/o exception **refuse** to use a command line installation process that wants to be run with `sudo`
* See the [project‚Äôs home][Homebrew Project website]

For primers on about the filesystem hierarchy & organization (it‚Äôs actually not just chaos). See the manual entry for `hier(7)` or the [Wiki article on the Unix filesystem][Unix filesystem: Conventional directory layout]

---

## Terminal.app ##

Good old sturdy, Terminal.app

* There are many terminal emulators, but this one ~~is mine~~ comes installed on my system
* It‚Äôs really mostly good enough

---

## Terminal.app, digging in ‚Ä¶ ##

Preferences
* meta key setup
* alternate color schemes/font sizes for presentations

Marks & Bookmarks
* setting bookmarks
* navigating between marks
* selecting between marks

---

## Terminal.app, digging in ‚Ä¶  m0ar ‚Ä¶ ##

Searching
* searching with selection
* pasting with selection

Selecting
* columnar selecting with `‚å•` dragging

Touch Bar
* man page
* up/down
* bookmark
* color picker (¬øwhy?)

---

## Specific Utilities ##

Now we are entering the realm of CLI ‚Üí GUI interaction, aka the good stuff

---

### `pbpaste(1)` and `pbcopy(1)` ###

* `pbpaste`: output contents of the ‚Äúpasteboard‚Äù to `STDOUT`
* `pbcopy`: write `STDIN` to the ‚Äúpasteboard‚Äù
* `pbmunge` hashtag-humblebrag on [my custom function for pasteboard manipulation][pbmunge.bash gist]

---

### `open(1)` ###

Open a file or folder, as if it has been double clicked on in the Finder. Or a URL in the correct application.

Common uses:

    open . # open current working directory in Finder
    open -a Mail some-file.txt # open Mail.app, creating a new blank message with some-file.txt as an attachment
    open https://daringfireball.net/ # open a url
    open -a Safari https://daringfireball.net/ # open a url with a specific browser
    open -a Sublime -W -n # -W: wait until quit, -n: open new instance. This is suitable to use for your VISUAL or EDITOR
    open -R path/to/my/file.jpg # reveal this item in the finder

More [from Brett Terpstra on `open(1)`][Brett Terpstra on open(1)]

---

## `defaults write` ##

Coming back to showing hidden files. Maybe you‚Äôve seen these?

    defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES # this is one is gross


    defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Screenshots

* These can be found out and about on the web
* Be wary of them
    * they get out of date a lot
    * some are dangerous; e.g., turning off Gatekeeper
    * some are redundant to GUI settings

I use [a logging script][log_defaults_writes.bash gist] little technique to record any writes that I make, so that I have some idea of what broke ~~if happen to~~ when I inevitably break something.

---

### `mdfind` ###

Search spotlight database.

    mdfind -name query # search file names only
    mdfind -0 # ASCII NUL after each file for piping output to other utils like `xargs -0`
    mdfind -onlyin ../path/to/dir # limit search to specified directory

---

### Quick Look ###

Open Quick Look from the command line. (This is one you might want to make an alias for).

    qlmanage -p my-pretty-picture.jpg
    alias qlook='qlmanage -p' # create bash alias

Apple Support has [a primer on Quick Look][macOS Sierra: Quick Look], in case you don‚Äôt know about.

[TidBITS has more on Quick Look][TidBITS on Quick Look], including plugins for other file types.

---

### `say(1)` ###

Text to speech from the command line.

If there is [an xkcd cartoon][xkcd on say(1)] on the topic, you know that it‚Äôs worth knowing about.

### `caffeinate` ###

Keep your mac from sleeping, or wake it if it is asleep. (Like `ssh` into your mac and run this)

## Made with Mac ##

Tools I used to make this

### KeyCastr ###

The lovely toast messages of my keyboard input, as I type are provided by the [Open Sourced KeyCastr App][KeyCastr project on GitHub]

### Marp ###

The [Marp Project][Marp project website] provides a pretty good Markdown ‚Üí SPA tool for making simple slide decks.
